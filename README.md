### linear Regression for single variable/feature and multiple features


we know that Linear regression is a Regression. It expects target feature to be continuous numericals . 

First plot the scatter plot for the available data ,and see the distribution of the data  If the data is linearly distributed then we apply linear regression algorithm. 

Goal of this Linear regression is to best fit the line so that it should cover all the datapoints(data) 

(by using **Y = mX + C** --> equation of the line , where 
  y is the target feature,
  m is the intercept
  X is the input feature
  C is the coeffients )
